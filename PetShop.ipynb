        "Pets are kept in closures and are fed food. The entity **Pet** has a foreign key *Enclosure_Number*, which is the primary key of the **Enclosure** entity. Pets can be kept in one and only one enclosure, but an enclosure can hold 0 up to 100 pets. The primary key of Pets is Pet_ID, which relates to the foreign key *Food_Type* in the **Food** entity. The Pet_ID determines what type of pet it is (cat, dog, etc), and the type of pet determines the food type (cat food, dog food, etc). Here, I am assuming that the tuples in food entity tracks bags of food, so one pet can be fed 0 bags of food up to 100 bags of food in a year. One bag of food can feed 0 up to 50 different pets. \n",
        "The Pets entity has also the foreign key *Pet_Transaction_#*, which is the primary key of the **Pet_Transaction** entity. This entity stores customer transactions for buying/adopting pets. Similarly, the **Food_Transaction** entity is for when a customer decides to buy pet food. A pet can be involved in 0 up to 1 transaction, but a transaction can involve 1 up to 50 pets. (50 pets can be bought at a time). A bag of food can be involved in 0 up to 1 transaction, but a transaction can involve 1 up to 50 bags of food. \n",
        "Finally, there is the **Customer** entity. It contains the primary key Customer_ID, which is also the foreign key of both the Pet_Transaction and Food_Transaction entities. A single transaction can be paid for by one and only one customer, but a customer can pay for 1 up to 100 transactions in a given year. There is also a loyalty program for customers, denoted by the attributes Pet_Loyalty_Level and Food_Loyalty_Level. Example values can be gold, silver, or bronze, depending on the subscription level of the customer. As a result, the Pet/Food_Transaction entities have a discount amount correlating to the loyalty level of the customer."
